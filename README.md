# SystemVerilog Verification â€“ Half Adder, Full Adder, Flip-Flops, Counters

This repository showcases **SystemVerilog-based verification** of fundamental digital circuits such as adders, flip-flops, and synchronous counters. The focus is on building **modular, self-checking testbenches**, using features like **assertions, procedural blocks,** and **simulation waveforms** to validate RTL designs.
